Group 17

By: Eva Moncada & Netra Patel

Welcome to our project repository! With Los Angeles being one of the most common vacation spots along with being many people's dream to live in, we thought it would be interesting to observe the safety of this beloved city. We will be examining the crime rates in Los Angeles County between 2020-2024 to determine how safe the county is. 


All of the coding for each graph will be explicitly shown. Netra completed the first 3 questions of the presentation (slides 2-10). This coding is listed under the "Netra" file. Eva completed the last 3 questions (slides 11-18). This coding is listed under the "Eva" file.
